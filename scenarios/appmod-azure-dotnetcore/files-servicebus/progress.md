# Migration Progress Tracker: MSMQ to Azure Service Bus

## Important Guideline
1. When you use terminal command tool, never input a long command with multiple lines, always use a single line command. (This is a bug in VS Copilot)
2. Never create a new project in the solution, always use the existing project to add new files or update the existing files.
3. Minimize code changes:
    - Update only what's necessary for the migration.
    - Avoid unrelated code enhancement.
4. Add New Package References to Projects
   Read the `.csproj` file of the target project, if there is SDK attribute in the <Project> element (e.g., `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">`), it is a .NET SDK-style project.
   - For .NET SDK style project, use the following command to add each package: `dotnet add package <PACKAGE_NAME> --version <VERSION>`.
   - For non-sdk style project, follow these steps:
       1. Unload the project via tool `unload_project`.
       2. Install each package to directory `packages` via command `nuget install <PACKAGE_NAME> -Version <VERSION> -OutputDirectory packages`.
       3. From the `packages` folder, identify the highest version of each installed package, record the package name and version.
       4. Use tool `get_file` to read and `edit_file` to modify the .csproj file, add the package reference.
       5. If needed, update Web.config or App.config files if necessary.
       6. After the modification, reload the project via tool `reload_project`. Make sure you always reload the project after unload a project, never leave projects unloaded in the solution.
5. **Task Tracking and Progress Updates**
   - Use checkmark to track the progress of each task in `progress.md`:
     - `[]` for tasks not started
     - `[X]` for tasks completed
     - `[in_progress]` for tasks currently being worked on
   - Before starting any migration task, mark it as `in_progress` in `progress.md`. Only one task should be marked as `in_progress` at a time.
   - As soon as a task is completed, immediately update its status to completed in `progress.md` before moving to the next task.
   - Update the status of tasks in real-time as you work, ensuring `progress.md` always reflects the current state.
   - If you discover new required tasks during migration, add them to `progress.md` and the plan immediately, and track their status as above.
   - Do not batch status updates; always update `progress.md` as soon as a task's status changes.
   - After all tasks are finished, review `progress.md` to ensure all tasks are finished and marked as complete.

## Migration Task List

- [X] Add Azure Service Bus and Azure Identity NuGet packages to the project
- [X] Add Azure Service Bus configuration to appsettings.json
- [X] Refactor MSMQService.cs to use Azure Service Bus SDK (replace all System.Messaging usage)
- [X] Refactor or remove Infrastructure/SystemMessaging.cs (remove MSMQ API simulation)
- [X] Update dependency injection in Program.cs to register new Service Bus service
- [X] Remove all MSMQ-related code, dependencies, and configuration
- [X] Build and verify successful compilation
- [X] Clean up and finalize migration
- [X] Mark final cleanup complete

## Migration Summary

? **MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

The migration from Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) to Azure Service Bus has been completed successfully. All tasks have been executed and verified:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Dependencies**: Added Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus (7.19.0) and Azure.Identity (1.14.0) packages
2. **Configuration**: Added Azure Service Bus configuration with managed identity support
3. **Service Migration**: Completely refactored MSMQService.cs to ServiceBusService.cs with Azure Service Bus SDK
4. **Code Cleanup**: Removed all System.Messaging references and MSMQ-specific code
5. **Infrastructure**: Removed Infrastructure/SystemMessaging.cs (MSMQ simulation wrapper)
6. **Dependency Injection**: Updated Program.cs to register ServiceBusService
7. **Controller Updates**: Updated HomeController to use new async Azure Service Bus methods

### Migration Features:
- ? Managed Identity authentication (no connection strings)
- ? Async/await pattern throughout
- ? Azure Service Bus queue management
- ? Message sending, receiving, and peeking operations
- ? Batch operations (replacing MSMQ transactions)
- ? Queue creation and administration
- ? Error handling and logging
- ? Compilation successful

The codebase now uses Azure Service Bus exclusively for message queuing operations, with all MSMQ dependencies removed.
