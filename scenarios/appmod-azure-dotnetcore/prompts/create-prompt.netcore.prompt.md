# Create a Prompt to Update Technology

Use the template [PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md](PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md) with [Technology X] and [Technology Y] being the technologies the prompt is addressing and create a prompt file (with the extension .prompt.md) in the `.github/prompts` folder that I can use to migrate the codebase. 

1. The generated prompt **MUST** include instructions to follow guidance from `migration-guidance.netcore.prompt.md`. This guidance is important and must not be overlooked.
1. The prompt must include instructions to build the code after making changes and to address any build errors that may arise.
1. The prompt must be only about making the specific change to the codebase required for the technology replacement. It should not include any other changes or modifications to the codebase.

## Important Note

Be sure to follow the instructions in the `migration-guidance.netcore.prompt.md` file.
