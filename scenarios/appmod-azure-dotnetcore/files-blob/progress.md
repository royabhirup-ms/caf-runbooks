# Migration Progress Tracker

## Important Guideline
1. When you use terminal command tool, never input a long command with multiple lines, always use a single line command. (This is a bug in VS Copilot)
2. Never create a new project in the solution, always use the existing project to add new files or update the existing files.
3. Minimize code changes:
    - Update only what's necessary for the migration.
    - Avoid unrelated code enhancement.
4. Add New Package References to Projects
   Read the `.csproj` file of the target project, if there is SDK attribute in the <Project> element (e.g., `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">`), it is a .NET SDK-style project.
   - For .NET SDK style project, use the following command to add each package: `dotnet add package <PACKAGE_NAME> --version <VERSION>`.
   - For non-sdk style project, follow these steps:
       1. Unload the project via tool `unload_project`.
       2. Install each package to directory `packages` via command `nuget install <PACKAGE_NAME> -Version <VERSION> -OutputDirectory packages`.
       3. From the `packages` folder, identify the highest version of each installed package, record the package name and version.
       4. Use tool `get_file` to read and `edit_file` to modify the .csproj file, add the package reference.
       5. If needed, update Web.config or App.config files if necessary.
       6. After the modification, reload the project via tool `reload_project`. Make sure you always reload the project after unload a project, never leave projects unloaded in the solution.
5. **Task Tracking and Progress Updates**
   - Use checkmark to track the progress of each task in `progress.md`:
     - `[]` for tasks not started
     - `[X]` for tasks completed
     - `[in_progress]` for tasks currently being worked on
   - Before starting any migration task, mark it as `in_progress` in `progress.md`. Only one task should be marked as `in_progress` at a time.
   - As soon as a task is completed, immediately update its status to completed in `progress.md` before moving to the next task.
   - Update the status of tasks in real-time as you work, ensuring `progress.md` always reflects the current state.
   - If you discover new required tasks during migration, add them to `progress.md` and the plan immediately, and track their status as above.
   - Do not batch status updates; always update `progress.md` as soon as a task’s status changes.
   - After all tasks are finished, review `progress.md` to ensure all tasks are finished and marked as complete.

## Migration Task List

- [X] Add Azure Blob Storage NuGet dependencies to the project
- [X] Update configuration to include Azure Blob Storage endpoint
- [X] Refactor HomeController.cs to replace System.IO.File usage with Azure Blob Storage SDK
- [X] Remove obsolete Local File IO code
- [X] Build and verify successful compilation
- [X] Clean up and finalize migration

## Migration Summary

? **Migration Completed Successfully!**

### What was migrated:
- **From:** Local File System IO operations using `System.IO.File` API
- **To:** Azure Blob Storage operations using Azure Storage Blobs SDK

### Changes made:
1. **Dependencies:** Added Azure.Storage.Blobs (12.24.0) and Azure.Identity (1.14.0) packages
2. **Configuration:** Added Azure Blob Storage endpoint configuration in appsettings.json
3. **Service Registration:** Registered BlobServiceClient with DefaultAzureCredential in Program.cs
4. **Code Migration:** Replaced local file operations in HomeController.Index() with Azure Blob Storage operations:
   - `System.IO.File.Exists()` ? `BlobClient.ExistsAsync()`
   - `System.IO.File.WriteAllText()` ? `BlobClient.UploadAsync()`
   - `System.IO.File.ReadAllText()` ? `BlobClient.DownloadContentAsync()`

### Build Status:
? All compilation issues resolved - Build successful

### Next Steps:
- Update Azure Blob Storage endpoint in appsettings.json with actual storage account URL
- Configure managed identity for authentication in production environment
