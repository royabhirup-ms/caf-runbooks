# Migration Progress: Plaintext Credential to Secure Credentials (Azure Key Vault)

## Important Guideline
1. When you use terminal command tool, never input a long command with multiple lines, always use a single line command. (This is a bug in VS Copilot)
2. Never create a new project in the solution, always use the existing project to add new files or update the existing files.
3. Minimize code changes:
    - Update only what's necessary for the migration.
    - Avoid unrelated code enhancement.
4. Add New Package References to Projects
   Read the `.csproj` file of the target project, if there is SDK attribute in the <Project> element (e.g., `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">`), it is a .NET SDK-style project.
   - For .NET SDK style project, use the following command to add each package: `dotnet add package <PACKAGE_NAME> --version <VERSION>`.
   - For non-sdk style project, follow these steps:
       1. Unload the project via tool `unload_project`.
       2. Install each package to directory `packages` via command `nuget install <PACKAGE_NAME> -Version <VERSION> -OutputDirectory packages`.
       3. From the `packages` folder, identify the highest version of each installed package, record the package name and version.
       4. Use tool `get_file` to read and `edit_file` to modify the .csproj file, add the package reference.
       5. If needed, update Web.config or App.config files if necessary.
       6. After the modification, reload the project via tool `reload_project`. Make sure you always reload the project after unload a project, never leave projects unloaded in the solution.
5. **Task Tracking and Progress Updates**
   - Use checkmark to track the progress of each task in `progress.md`:
     - `[]` for tasks not started
     - `[X]` for tasks completed
     - `[in_progress]` for tasks currently being worked on
   - Before starting any migration task, mark it as `in_progress` in `progress.md`. Only one task should be marked as `in_progress` at a time.
   - As soon as a task is completed, immediately update its status to completed in `progress.md` before moving to the next task.
   - Update the status of tasks in real-time as you work, ensuring `progress.md` always reflects the current state.
   - If you discover new required tasks during migration, add them to `progress.md` and the plan immediately, and track their status as above.
   - Do not batch status updates; always update `progress.md` as soon as a task's status changes.
6. After all tasks are finished, review `progress.md` to ensure all tasks are finished and marked as complete.

## Migration Task List

- [X] Add Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets (1.4.0) NuGet package
- [X] Add Azure.Identity (1.14.0) NuGet package
- [X] Create or update appsettings.json with KeyVaultName
- [X] Update Program.cs to add Azure Key Vault configuration
- [X] Refactor Controllers/HomeController.cs to remove all hardcoded secrets and use Key Vault
- [X] Refactor Controllers/SecurityController.cs to remove all hardcoded secrets and use Key Vault
- [X] Clean up obsolete code/configuration related to plaintext credentials
- [X] Verify build and compilation

## Migration Summary

**Migration Status: COMPLETED ?**

All plaintext credentials have been successfully migrated to use Azure Key Vault for secure credential management:

1. **Azure Key Vault packages added** - Both Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets (1.4.0) and Azure.Identity (1.14.0) packages were successfully installed.

2. **Configuration updated** - The appsettings.json file was cleaned of all hardcoded secrets and configured with KeyVaultName for Azure Key Vault integration.

3. **Program.cs enhanced** - Added Azure Key Vault configuration using DefaultAzureCredential for secure, managed identity-based authentication.

4. **Controllers refactored** - Both HomeController.cs and SecurityController.cs were updated to:
   - Remove all hardcoded passwords, connection strings, API keys, and secrets
   - Use IConfiguration to retrieve secure values from Azure Key Vault
   - Maintain all existing functionality while eliminating security vulnerabilities

5. **Build verification passed** - The project compiles successfully with no errors.

**Key Security Improvements:**
- Eliminated all hardcoded credentials (passwords, connection strings, API keys, tokens)
- Implemented Azure Key Vault integration with managed identity
- Maintained application functionality while enhancing security posture
- Followed .NET 9 best practices for secure configuration management

(Track each task using the checkboxes above. Mark as [in_progress] when working, [X] when done.)
