# Local Caching to Azure Redis Cache Migration Progress

## Migration Tasks

### 1. Add Required NuGet Packages
- [✓] Add Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis package
- [✓] Add Azure.Identity package
- [✓] Verify build after package addition

### 2. Update Program.cs
- [✓] Replace `builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();` with Redis cache configuration
- [✓] Configure Redis connection with managed identity
- [✓] Verify build after changes

### 3. Update Configuration Files
- [✓] Add Redis connection configuration to appsettings.json
- [✓] Add Redis connection configuration to appsettings.Development.json
- [✓] Verify build after changes

### 4. Code Usage Updates
- [✓] Search for any IMemoryCache usage in controllers/services (None found)
- [✓] Replace any IMemoryCache injections with IDistributedCache (None found)
- [✓] Verify build after changes

### 5. Final Verification
- [✓] Run final build verification
- [✓] Confirm all local caching has been replaced with Azure Redis Cache

## Build Status
- Initial build status: Not verified
- Current build status: ✅ SUCCESS - Build succeeded with only 1 analyzer version warning (not related to migration)
